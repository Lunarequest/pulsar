# Changelog

## v0.0.3
Patched *a lot* of bugs, and added a webpage on the localhost server.

## v0.0.2
A lot has changed in the last 24 hours. I've fixed a bug that seems to have only been occurring on Windows, where the window would close before a url is opened, so the url just wouldn't get opened. Additionally, I've added features such as a HTTP server running in the background, which means that automatic sign in on [the Alles website](https://alles.cx) now works! The window now opens more gracefully, you can no longer accidentally start multiple instances, and the tray icon has been removed.

## v0.0.1
The first version of Pulsar! Probably a few bugs.
